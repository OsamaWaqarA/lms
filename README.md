# Library Management System (Java)

I built this project alone in my second semester hackathon.  
It is a Library Management System that manages students, books, and records using OOP principles and file handling.

---

## Features
- Add and remove students  
- Issue and return books  
- Track student history  
- Manage records using file-based storage  

---

## Technologies Used
- Java (Core Java, OOP, File Handling)

---

## How It Works
- Students and books are stored as files.  
- Books can be issued/returned, and the system checks conditions before actions.  
- Student history and book status are displayed in the console.  

---

## Project Structure
- `Students.java` → Handles student records  
- `Books.java` → Handles book details and issuing  
- `Data_handling.java` → Provides file handling utilities  
- `Main.java` → Entry point of the program

## Note
This project was completed during a hackathon under time pressure, showing my ability to apply concepts quickly. It is not my most advanced work but demonstrates solid understanding of OOP and file management in Java.
